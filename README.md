## Hi, I’m Ketaki 👋

I’m a **Full Stack Engineer** with a strong backend and systems background, and a growing focus on **Machine Learning systems and LLM inference**.  
I enjoy building end-to-end products, digging into performance bottlenecks, and working at the intersection of software engineering and applied ML.

---

### 🔧 What I work on
- Backend systems, APIs, and data pipelines
- ML-backed applications and inference pipelines
- LLM systems (RAG, embeddings, retrieval, serving)
- Developer tools, automation, and infra-heavy projects

---

### 🚀 Featured Work
- **LLM / RAG Systems** – Built retrieval-augmented generation pipelines using modern LLM stacks, focusing on low-latency semantic search and clean system design.
- **ML Pipelines & Inference** – Experience optimizing inference workflows, working with embeddings, model serving, and performance tradeoffs.
- **Backend & Full Stack Projects** – Designed and shipped APIs, dashboards, and internal tools using Python, FastAPI/Flask, React, and SQL.
- **Data & Systems Projects** – Built scalable data processing and automation workflows with an emphasis on reliability and clarity.

(Each pinned repo includes architecture details, setup instructions, and key learnings.)
